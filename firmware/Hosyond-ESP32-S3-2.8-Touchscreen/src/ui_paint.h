// The drawing vocabulary the screens are built from, with no screen state in it.
//
// Split out of ui.cpp when the UI stopped being rectangles. The reason for the split is not line
// count: these are the only functions in the firmware that decide what the product LOOKS like, and
// having them in one file with no `screen` variable in sight is what stops a shape being tuned for
// one screen and diverging on the next.
//
// Everything here resolves through display.cpp's soft-shape primitives, which composite an
// anti-aliased distance field rather than filling a rectangle. There is deliberately no wrapper for
// fillRect or drawFastHLine: clearing a band is still a rectangle because it is invisible, but
// nothing a person can see is drawn with a hard corner or a one-pixel rule.
