// On-board microphone and speaker, through the single ES8311 mono codec.
//
// Extracted from main.cpp when the screen gained a push-to-talk button. The reason is not tidiness:
// the old capture loop blocked inside `while (digitalRead(BOOT) == LOW)`, which is fine for a
// diagnostic and impossible for a UI — the orb stops, the touch controller is never polled, and the
// finger that is holding the button cannot be seen to lift. Recording is therefore a state the
// caller pumps once per frame rather than a function that returns when the clip is done.
//
// Every entry point is declared unconditionally and compiles to a stub when ENABLE_AUDIO_CAPTURE is
// 0, so the display build has no #if scattered through its UI code and honestly reports that it has
// no microphone.
