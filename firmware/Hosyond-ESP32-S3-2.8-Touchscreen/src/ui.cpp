// to be drawn beside it was a hard-cornered fill and a one-pixel rule, which is two products on one

//   56       content
//   262      action bar, WHEN there is something to press — otherwise content runs to 320
//   320
//
// Two things move and nothing else does: the status drawer slides down out of the header, and the
// action bar rises out of the bottom edge. Both are eased. The content underneath is repainted on
// change, which is what keeps a list screen inside the frame budget.

// and every arm names both the animation and the word under it — the two are returned together
// precisely so they cannot drift apart. Deriving the label from the mode, as this used to, meant
// every calm state said "Thinking", including a revoked credential and a failed turn.
//
// The vocabulary is the one the gateway really speaks, checked against the server rather than
// assumed:
//
//   threads[].status   running | starting | streaming | completed | error | stopped | idle
//                      (app.mjs deviceThreadStatus(): active work wins over a stale session, and
//                      anything else is T3's own latestTurn.state or session.status verbatim)
//   response.state     waiting | streaming | complete | empty | error  (deviceThreadOutput.mjs)
//   display.state      ready | setup   (displayState.mjs), plus boot/unknown/error set locally
//
// orbModeForAgentState() in the shared ThinkingOrb also matches searching / solving / planning /
// weaving / composing / writing / shaping / pairing / listening. None of those strings exist
// anywhere in src/ — that mapper is written against a vocabulary this gateway does not have. It is
// still consulted, last, for a status word this table does not recognise, so that a gateway which
// one day publishes a real agent verb lights the matching animation with no firmware change.

// `speaks` is the classification that decides what gets the prominent line on HOME.
//
// The orb has nine animations, so in normal operation the state word beside it is redundant — the
// thread's NAME is the thing nothing else on the screen carries, and it is what a person needs to
// see before they speak into the device. But several states all render the calm Ring, and for those
// the word is the entire message: the orb cannot tell "Revoked" from "Idle", and hiding that behind
// a thread name would hide a fault behind a decoration.
//
// So: THE PROMINENT LINE SHOWS THE THREAD NAME UNLESS THE STATE CARRIES INFORMATION THE ORB CANNOT
