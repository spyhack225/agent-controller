// The vendor's own examples map the FT6336G's raw range straight onto the display at rotation 0:
// x over 0..240, y over 0..320, no swap and no inversion (docs/.../Example_29_touch_pen/touch.h).
// This adapter runs the panel at rotation 0, so the mapping is the identity — but it is expressed
// as three flags in one place because a touch panel bonded the other way up is a one-line fix here
// and an unfindable bug everywhere else. TOUCH_TRACE prints raw and mapped coordinates so a bench
// session can tell which of the three is wrong rather than guessing.
