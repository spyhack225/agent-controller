// ILI9341V panel adapter for the Hosyond ES3C28P.
//
// The panel has no reset GPIO — its reset is tied to the ESP32-S3's CHIP_PU rail, so the only way
// to reset the panel is to reset the chip. Adafruit_ILI9341 accepts -1 for that.
//
// The SPI pins are not the ESP32-S3 defaults, so the bus is remapped with SPI.begin() before the
// panel is initialised.

// Panel output polarity.
//
// This glass renders what we send inverted: a 0x0000 fill comes out white. Both invertDisplay(true)
// and invertDisplay(false) were flashed and photographed, and the screen was identical white both
// times — the ILI9341's INVON/INVOFF simply does not control this panel's polarity, whatever the
// vendor's own init sequence does with 0x21 alongside their own gamma and power registers.
//
// So the correction happens here, where the bytes are ours and the result is deterministic. Every
// colour written to the panel goes through panelRgb()/panelGrey(). Flip this to 0 for a panel that
// behaves normally; it is one constant rather than a hunt through the drawing code.

// The orb is an anti-aliased point cloud. Everything that used to be drawn beside it was
// fillRect corners and 1 px hairlines, which is a different product sharing one piece of glass.
// These composite a signed-distance field straight onto the panel through the same DMA staging
// row the orb blit uses: no second buffer, coverage blended against a known flat ground, and a
// `feather` that can be wider than one pixel where an edge should read as soft rather than merely
// un-jagged.
//
// Greys are 0..255 BEFORE panelGrey(), matching the rest of this adapter. `fillGrey` and
// `strokeGrey` accept -1 for "none", which is how a stroke-only capsule or a plain fill is asked
// for without two functions.
//
// Everything here clips to the panel. The staging row holds exactly one panel width, so a shape
// that starts left of the origin or runs past the right edge is trimmed against THAT row's
// capacity rather than the shape's own.

// A rounded rectangle. `radius >= min(w, h) / 2` is a capsule; `radius == 0` is a rectangle with
// anti-aliased edges, which is still not the same thing as fillRect and is not what this is for.

// rounded end have any curvature in them. This splits the shape: the caps go through the field, the
// middle goes through the panel's own accelerated fill. Same picture, a fraction of the arithmetic.
//
// `roundTop` / `roundBottom` say which ends are actually on screen. A tray that slides up from
// below the bezel has no bottom corners to draw.
