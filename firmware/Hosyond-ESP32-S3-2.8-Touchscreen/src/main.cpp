// Hosyond / LCDWIKI ES3C28P — 2.8" IPS ESP32-S3 touchscreen module.
//
// This file is the board: power-on reporting, pins, radios, the one physical button, and the loop
// that drives everything else. The product lives next door — src/ui.cpp owns the five screens, the
// shared AgentControllerCore owns the gateway conversation, and src/audio.cpp owns the codec.
//
// The controller is usable from the glass: pick a thread, hold to record a voice note, run a saved
// action, read the reply, approve a held command. There is no keyboard and there will not be one;
// on a device like this a request is made by voice or by choosing something the owner saved
// earlier, and every on-device edit is a bounded choice.
//
// BOOT is overloaded and the overload is deliberate: a tap reopens the configuration portal (the
// escape hatch for a wrong gateway URL, which otherwise leaves a unit online and unable to reach
// anything), while a hold of PROVISIONING_RESET_HOLD_MS wipes Wi-Fi and re-enters provisioning —
// the recovery for a revoked device, a house move, or a resale.
