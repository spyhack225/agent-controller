// Wi-Fi provisioning: the boot state machine plus its first transport, a SoftAP captive portal.
//
// The rule the whole design serves: the device never blocks indefinitely in any state. Every state
// has a screen, and every failure has a next action visible on that screen. The old firmware looped
// forever inside connectWiFi(), so a mistyped password bricked the unit until someone reflashed it
// over USB.
//
// BLE is the intended second transport (deferred until there is a companion app). It plugs in as
// another ProvisioningTransport rather than a rewrite, which is why the seam exists now.
