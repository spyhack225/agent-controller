// A rotating point-cloud sphere: the agent-state indicator for boards with a real display.
//
// Ported from Thinking Orbs by Jakub Antalik (MIT), https://orbs.jakubantalik.com — specifically
// `spec/orbs-spec.json`, which is the library's own machine-readable definition of each mode and
// its parameters. Attribution and licence in ThinkingOrb.cpp.
//
// The component computes; it does not draw. It emits a depth-sorted list of screen-space dots with
// a radius and an ink level, and the board's display adapter paints them however it can. That
// keeps one implementation working across an e-ink panel, an IPS TFT, and an AMOLED, which
// otherwise share nothing.
//
// Why this and not an animated GIF or a sprite sheet: the orb has to represent *which* thing the
// agent is doing, and it has to keep moving during a multi-minute turn without burning flash on
// frames. A parametric sphere is a few hundred floats and reads as alive at 12 fps.
