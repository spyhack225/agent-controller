// no board in them.
//
// These are the structures the CrowPanel firmware grew inside its main.cpp — DeviceControl,
// ThreadOption, the response paging state — lifted out so a second board does not have to reinvent
// them. Field names and defaults follow that implementation exactly, because the gateway's wire
// format is what they encode, not a taste.
//
// EVERY collection here is a fixed array. Nothing grows. This runs alongside a renderer that wants
// its frame budget, and an unbounded String vector fragmenting the heap over days of uptime is the
// failure mode that does not show up on the bench. The caps are stated next to each one; a payload
// larger than a cap is truncated, and truncation is logged rather than silently absorbed.
