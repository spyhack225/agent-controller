/**
 * The order the operator has put their environments, folders and threads in.
 *
 * This is a **client preference, not gateway state**, and deliberately so. Environments are rows
 * the gateway owns, but projects and threads are a mirror of a paired T3 instance's snapshot — the
 * gateway has no authority over them and T3's orchestration HTTP API exposes no ordering to write
 * back to. Persisting only the third of the tree the gateway happens to own would make one branch
 * behave differently from the other two, so all three are kept here, together, in local storage.
 *
 * The consequence is honest and worth knowing: a reordering follows the browser, not the account.
 *
 * Every list is addressed by a **scope key** so one storage shape covers all three levels:
 *
 *   environments                  every environment on the account
 *   projects:<environmentId>      the folders inside one environment
 *   threads:<projectId>           the threads inside one folder
 *   threads:                      threads the snapshot reported without a folder
