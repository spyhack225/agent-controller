// six milestones a small screen can actually show and nothing else.

// `recorded` and `uploading` are never produced from a job — the gateway does not exist yet at
// those points in the capture. They are listed here anyway so firmware, console and gateway share
// one vocabulary rather than three near-identical ones.

/**
 * Whether this device may send a finished transcript on without a person looking at it.

 * three-valued underneath: the owner's explicit choice if they made one, and otherwise the
 * hardware's default — on for a device that has declared a microphone on a heartbeat, off for one
 * that never has. A controller whose purpose is to be spoken to should work when it is spoken to;
 * a board with no microphone is never handed a licence it could not use.
 *
 * Still per device, never per account. Auto-send is a trust decision about one microphone in one
 * room: an account-wide switch would extend it to the next controller the owner claims, and a
 * device that arrives later must earn its own answer from its own hardware. `enabledBy` is the
 * owner who granted it explicitly, and stays null for the default — a default has nobody behind it
 * and must not be recorded as though somebody signed for it.
