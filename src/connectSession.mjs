// back to the browser and paste it. That order is backwards — the person is already signed in to the
// console, and the console is the only place that knows which account the host should land in.
//
// A connect session inverts it. The console mints a short-lived, single-use enrollment code while
// the user is authenticated, hands them one command to run on the host, and then polls. The
// connector CLI redeems the code at `POST /v1/connectors/enroll`, which is deliberately *not* in the
// platform-user realm: the CLI has no Clerk session and the copyable one-liner never carries a
// platform token or local T3 credential.
//
// The code is the credential, so it follows the device claim-code rules exactly: hashed at rest,
// compared with timingSafeEqual, single use, and refused (not ignored) once expired.

// Minutes, not days. Unlike a device claim code — printed at manufacture and read weeks later — this
// one is read off the screen and pasted into a terminal in the same sitting.
