// What the agent is *doing*, derived from real T3 evidence — never guessed.
//
// The controller's orb renders nine animations, one per verb. Five were driven; four
// (searching / solving / weaving / shaping) had no gateway signal behind them at all.
// This module is that signal, and it is deliberately conservative: a wrong animation is a
// lie about what the agent is doing, so every predicate below names the T3 field it reads
// and returns null the moment the evidence runs out.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHERE THE EVIDENCE COMES FROM
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `GET /api/orchestration/snapshot` cannot answer this. Verified against the installed
// T3 Code 0.0.32 contract (source map at /opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/t3/dist/bin.mjs.map,
// `sourcesContent` for packages/contracts/src/*.ts and src/orchestration/*.ts):
//
//   src/orchestration/http.ts, handler "snapshot":
//     "Serve the lightweight command read model (thread bodies empty) instead of the fully
//      hydrated snapshot. Hydrating every message and activity payload in the database has
//      OOM-killed servers […] UI clients load the shell and per-thread snapshots instead."
//
//   test/fixtures/t3-snapshot.json confirms it live: every thread carries exactly
//   {id, projectId, title, modelSelection, latestTurn, session} — no messages, no activities.
//
// The hydrated route is `GET /api/orchestration/threads/:threadId` (contract:
// packages/contracts/src/environmentHttp.ts, endpoint "threadSnapshot", success
// `OrchestrationThreadDetailSnapshot`, optional `?turnLimit=` query window). Its
// `thread.activities[]` is the work log, and it is what this module reads.
//
// Each activity (packages/contracts/src/orchestration.ts, `OrchestrationThreadActivity`) is
//   { id, tone: info|tool|approval|error, kind, summary, payload, turnId, sequence, createdAt }
// and the tool rows are emitted by src/orchestration/Layers/ProviderRuntimeIngestion.ts as
//   kind: "tool.started" | "tool.updated" | "tool.completed"   (tone "tool")
//   summary: the provider's tool title ("Read file", "Terminal", "Grep", …)
//   payload: { itemType, status?, detail?, data? }
// where `itemType` is one of TOOL_LIFECYCLE_ITEM_TYPES (packages/contracts/src/providerRuntime.ts):
//   command_execution | file_change | mcp_tool_call | dynamic_tool_call |
//   collab_agent_tool_call | web_search | image_view
//
// `payload.data` is slimmed server-side before it ships (src/orchestration/ActivityPayloadProjection.ts,
// `projectActivityPayload`), and the slimming keeps exactly: item.command, command, files[].path,
// toolCallId, `kind`, rawOutput. So `data.kind` and `data.files` are on the wire; `data.rawInput`
// is NOT, and nothing here may depend on it.

// contract that is checked in rather than a guess about tool names.
