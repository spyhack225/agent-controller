 * Device profiles map a device (or a signed-in web client acting as one) to a capability set.

 * - **Built-in profiles** — the three shipped defaults below, addressed by string id. These are
 *   the only ids `isKnownDeviceProfile()` accepts, so they remain the only values persisted on a
 *   device record.
 * - **Custom profiles** — a caller-supplied plain object `{ id, capabilities }` passed straight to
 *   `capabilitiesForProfile()` / `resolveDeviceProfile()`. Nothing is stored: the caller owns the
 *   lifetime of the object (config file, per-request override, future org policy document). This is
 *   deliberately database-free.

  // writes a standing permission rule into the provider session that outlives the moment it was
  // granted in. A durable grant made by tapping a button on a 240x320 panel — where the request
  // detail is clipped to a line and a half — is not the same act as making it in the console with
  // the full diff on screen, so the built-in hardware profile does not carry it.

  //
  // ONE capability, not two, and deliberately not split the way `approval_response` was. The
  // split there existed because `acceptForSession` writes a standing permission rule that
  // outlives the moment it was granted in — a genuinely different act. Nothing here does that:
  // an answer is consumed by the turn that asked and leaves nothing behind. The most powerful
  // shape, free text, is exactly as powerful as sending the agent a message, and every profile
  // below that carries `user_input_response` already carries `agent_prompt`. A second capability
  // would gate nothing that is not already gated.
  //
  // What IS restricted is where an answer may be given from, and that is a transport rule rather
  // than a policy one: the device realm accepts only a single short multiple-choice question,
  // because a 240x320 panel with five keys cannot take dictation. See
