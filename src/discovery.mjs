// LAN discovery, so a controller does not have to be told the gateway's address.
//
// The device is on the same network as the gateway, and typing a URL on a device with no keyboard
// is the single worst step in setup — it is where a typo strands a unit that is otherwise working.
// A broadcast probe removes the typing.
//
// Deliberately UDP broadcast rather than mDNS. mDNS would be more idiomatic, but a conformant
// responder is a large amount of protocol for one question, and the repo runs on zero runtime
// dependencies. `node:dgram` is core, and the exchange here is two datagrams:
//
//   device  -> 255.255.255.255:PORT   "AGENTCTL?"
//   gateway -> device                 {"service":"agent-controller","baseUrl":"http://…", …}
//
// The reply is unicast back to the asker, so this never floods the network with announcements the
// way a periodic beacon would.
