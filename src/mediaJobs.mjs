// record stuck at `processing`. Jobs are rows now and this worker drives them.

// createApp(), with a runOnce() tests call directly so no suite ever depends on a timer firing.

// dispatched, with `failed` as the terminal error state. "dispatched" means the finished transcript
// has been written onto the media record, which is what the audio-prompt path in src/media.mjs
